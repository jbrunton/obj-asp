# ObjAsp

This repository is an implementation of a language I developed for my masters thesis:

[A Higher-order Aspect-oriented Language](https://github.com/downloads/jbrunton/obj-asp/report.pdf)


## Building the interpreter

First, you'll need to install **OCaml**, which you can [download from here](http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html).

Then, clone the repository and ```make``` the interpreter:

    git clone git@github.com:jbrunton/obj-asp.git
    cd obj-asp/oasp
    make

## Usage

Simply:

    ./main <source file>
